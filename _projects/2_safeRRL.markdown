title: Safe Relational Reinforcement Learning by Look-ahead Planning
description: An agent performs model-free reinforcement learning (e.g. Q-learning) to learn an optimal policy. However, commonly used exploration strategies (e.g. Îµ-greedy) sometimes select a random action, which can result in catastrophic situations. We use a "teacher" that has only safety related knowledge about the environment and blocks dangerous actions.

<!-- You can also put regular text between your rows of images. Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images. You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then.... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images. -->
